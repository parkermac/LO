These files are WA Dept. of Ecology water column samples, both bottle and CTD. These were acquired via Public Records Request #P019860-042924 initiated 2024/04/29 by Dakota Mascarenas.

The list of files received is as follows:
* Aug1973toOct1989CTDandDiscrete.xlsx
* Letter_to_modelers_v2.pdf
* Letter_to_public_data_requestors_v2.pdf
* MarineWatersMetadata_v4.pdf
* Nov1989toDec1998CTDprofiles.xlsx
* Nov1989toDec1998Discrete.xlsx

NOTE: Despite the labeling on the Excel files received from WA Dept. of Ecology records request, we consider all data in  the file "Aug1973toOct1989CTDandDiscrete.xlsx" to be bottle (discrete) data. Email requests for information were sent on 2025/05/06 with follow up on 2025/09/03.

Metadata is found in these files. File data ranges are indicated in filenames.

Also included in the associated LO_data folder is the file: "ParkerMacCreadyCoreStationInfoFeb2018.xlsx". This comes from apogee: dat1/parker/LO_data/ecology/ and gives station identifiers for modern and historical Ecology data.

These datasets were initially primarily used for DO, temperature, and salinity. However, other variables are included (see Excel files).
