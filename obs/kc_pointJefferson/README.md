These files are from King County's monitoring of the water column near Point Jefferson, both bottle and CTD samples.

Data was received via email from Taylor Martin, King County, to Dakota Mascarenas on 2024/05/02.

Station information downloaded in March 2024 by Dakota Mascarenas from: https://data.kingcounty.gov/Environment-Waste-Management/WLRD-Sites/wbhs-bbzf

Email correspondences is included in the corresponding data folder for methods information: "his_methods_email - TM to DM 20250117.pdf"

NOTE: TaylorQuality and TaylorNote columns are considered insofar as to filter to only TaylorQuality = 'ok'.

NOTE: "field" data and temperature are from CTD and others are from bottle. I use temperature from CTD for bottles for ease of use in observation/model comparison.This is all included in "bottle_DO_data_for_Dakota.csv" despite the name.
