- **Line P** Historic Data collected three times a year at Line P off coastal Canadian waters off Vancouver island.
- Data are publicly available at https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/data-donnees/line-p/data-eng.html.  NOTE: NOT complied
  
  - ctd: 1956-2007
  - bottle: 1956-2007
    
- the 2nd method to download data is through: https://www.waterproperties.ca/linep/index.php. NOTE: you need to register first and manualy download year by year. It's NOT complied.
  
  - ctd: 1956-2023 
  - bottle: 1956-2023
  - NOTE: **CTD_oxygen** data was missing before year 2004; **bottle** data from the first two methods only contain nutrients **(e.g., N, P, Si)**. If you want to have CARBON variables **(e.g., DIC, TA)**, try the **3rd** method below


- the 3rd method to download compiled bottle data is through NCEI (Recommended): https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/ncei/ocads/metadata/0234342.html.   NOTE: compiled
