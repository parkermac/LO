CTD data was received by Dakota Mascarenas from Greg Ikeda, King County, via file transfer on 2024/04/05.

Two email correspondences are attached for further metadata:
* "metadata_questions_email - GI to DM 20230726.pdf" - answers to specific unit/processing questions
* "his_methods_email - TM to DM 20250117.pdf" - explains sampling method change overtime especially for dissolved oxygen

NOTE: Light transmission is currently not considered in this data processing. However, for future use, reference https://green2.kingcounty.gov/marine/Monitoring/OffshoreCTD: "Light Transmission data prior to May 19, 2014 were referenced to air. After this date, all Light Transmission data are referenced to water. To convert the pre-May 19, 2014 data to ‘referenced to water’, multiply the values by 1.095."
