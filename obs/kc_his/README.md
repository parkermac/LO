These files are from King County's monitoring of the water column near Point Jefferson, both bottle samples at now-defunct historical stations.

Data was received via email from Taylor Martin, King County, to Dakota Mascarenas on 2024/03/27.

Email correspondences is included in the corresponding data folder for methods information: "his_methods_email - TM to DM 20250117.pdf"

NOTE: "field" data and temperature are from CTD and others are from bottle. I use temperature from CTD for bottles for ease of use in observation/model comparison.This is all included in "bottle_DO_data_for_Dakota.csv" despite the name.
